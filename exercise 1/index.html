  <h3>Method1 Looking for Signs of Mice</h3>
 <ol>
  <li><strong>Look for droppings. </strong>Check for mouse droppings near common problem areas, such as kitchen cabinets or in your pantry. Inspect the area for dark droppings that look like grains of rice and are about 3⁄16–1⁄4 in (0.5–0.6 cm) long. Droppings that are wet and black are fresh while older ones are dry and have a lighter gray color.[1]<br/>The presence of droppings can also indicate that there's a crack or hole in the room through which mice can enter.<img src="images\aid1273953-v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-Mice-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp.jpg" alt="[1]"/></li>
    <li><strong>Listen for scratching or squeaking near sunrise and sunset.</strong> <A NAME="codeword">Mice are the most active 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise since they’re nocturnal. Listen for light scratching or scampering sounds near your walls or in areas where you suspect mice. If you hear multiple squeaks or noises, you may have more than 1 mouse in your home.[2]<br/>Common areas where you may hear mice include basements, attics, and kitchens.<img src="images\aid1273953-v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-Mice-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp.jpg" alt="[1]"/></li>
<li><strong>Look for dime-sized holes in your walls near the floor.</strong> If mice are living in your walls, they may have chewed through the drywall to get into your home. Inspect corners in your home or underneath cabinets to see if you there small holes with smooth edges. If you notice any holes, then mice can easily get in and out of your home.[3]<br/>Don’t forget to inspect outside your home as well since mice may be coming in from the wild.<img src="images\aid1273953-v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-Mice-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp.jpg" alt="[3]"/></li>

<li><strong>Watch along interior walls or ledges for mouse pathways.</strong> Mice usually follow the same pathways while they run through your home, so you may be able to see common problem areas. Usually, the runs are along interior walls or on ledges surrounding your home. Look for oily rub marks on the wall to see if mice have been in the area.[4]<br/>You may also notice droppings or urine stains along the pathways as well.<br/>Look for any small, sudden movements you notice in your home since they could be mice.<img src="images\aid1273953-v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-Mice-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp.jpg" alt="[4]"/></li>
<li><strong>Look for signs of a nest in attics or basements.</strong> Mice will build nests when they breed so they have a comfortable space for their young. Check for round nests made of cardboard, fabric, and other scrap materials in your attic, basement, and underneath your cabinets. If you find a nest, contact a professional exterminator immediately so they can get rid of it properly.[5]</br>Mice chew through cardboard boxes and items of clothing to use as materials for their nests. Look for tiny holes in the pile of clothes you've left sitting in the back of your closet.</br>A musty smell might also indicate the presence of a mouse nest.<img src="images\aid1273953-v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-Mice-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp.jpg" alt="[5]"/></li>
